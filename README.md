# Farm-Connect : Connecting the farmers pan-India

This is an initiative to connect all the farmers of India directly to the markets.
This will ensure that consumers get fresh vegetables at tlow prices right at their doorstep,
and also help farmers make REAL PROFITS(no middlemen are involved here).
This project is an attempt to replace the traditional system of buying and purchasing farm greens with a fast, reliable and secure online system.
Starting or shifting the farm product selling business online helps in capturing a large audience base. 
The online marketplaces offer advertisement opportunities to market our business online via banner ads or listing the store at top searches .
It is a plan to facilitate direct selling platforms to sell fruits and vegetables ,a move aimed at cutting out the middlemen 
,allowing farmers to sell directly to consumers, thus helping them save high intermediation costs. 
The platform would seek to bring about transparency and cut out brokers from the scene by allowing sale through this platform.
Farmers don't just work till the sun goes down ! They work till the job gets done.
This is our bid to empower the farm heroes .
